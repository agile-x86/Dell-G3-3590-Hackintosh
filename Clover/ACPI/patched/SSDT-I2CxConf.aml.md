Get SSDT-I2CxConf here, and apply the ACPI patches it requires. Listed on top of the .dsl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williambj1/VoodooI2C-PreRelease/master/SSDT-I2CxConf.dsl

(If you're just using my config.plist with a different serial number, these patches should already be in the config.plist)

Or alternatively download my procompiled one here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tcz0PuiBGiITK-pBuUbZKdA6_lQ9BaET/view?usp=sharing
